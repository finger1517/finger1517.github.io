## üéØ Why Hugo + PaperMod?

When I decided to create a personal website, I wanted something that was:

- **Fast**: Static sites load instantly
- **Simple**: Focus on content, not complex setup
- **Beautiful**: Clean, modern design
- **Flexible**: Easy to customize and extend

Hugo with the PaperMod theme ticked all these boxes perfectly.

## üöÄ Quick Setup Guide

### 1. Install Hugo

```bash
# On macOS
brew install hugo

# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install hugo

# Check installation
hugo version
```

### 2. Create Your Site

```bash
hugo new site my-website
cd my-website
```

### 3. Add PaperMod Theme

```bash
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod
```

### 4. Basic Configuration

Create `hugo.yaml`:

```yaml
baseURL: "https://yourusername.github.io/"
languageCode: "en-us"
title: "Your Name"
theme: ["PaperMod"]

params:
  author: "Your Name"
  description: "Your personal website description"

  homeInfoParams:
    Title: "Hi there üëã"
    Content: "Welcome to my personal corner of the internet."
```

### 5. Create Content

```bash
# Create homepage
echo "# Welcome to My Site" > content/_index.md

# Create a blog post
hugo new posts/hello-world.md
```

### 6. Build and Preview

```bash
# Preview locally
hugo server -D

# Build for production
hugo --minify
```

## üé® Customization Tips

### Theme Configuration

PaperMod offers extensive customization options:

```yaml
params:
  # Social links
  socialIcons:
    - name: github
      url: "https://github.com/yourusername"
    - name: twitter
      url: "https://twitter.com/yourusername"

  # Feature toggles
  ShowReadingTime: true
  ShowShareButtons: false
  ShowPostNavLinks: true
  ShowBreadCrumbs: true
```

### Custom CSS

Create `assets/css/custom.css` for additional styling:

```css
/* Custom styles */
.site-title {
  color: #your-color;
}
```

## üöÄ Deployment

### GitHub Pages

1. Push your Hugo source to a GitHub repository
2. Set up GitHub Actions for automatic deployment
3. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/`

### Other Options

- **Netlify**: Great for custom domains
- **Vercel**: Excellent performance
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: For ultimate control

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Features

### Shortcodes

Hugo's shortcodes make content creation powerful:

```markdown
{{< figure src="/images/diagram.png" title="System Architecture" >}}
```

### Taxonomies

Organize content with tags and categories:

```yaml
---
title: "My Post"
tags: ["hugo", "web-dev"]
categories: ["Tutorial"]
---
```
